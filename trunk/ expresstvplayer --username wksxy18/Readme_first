  A TV Player supports many TV sanderds such as DVB,T-DMB,CMMB and so on.
ExpressTVPlayer player can show SI information: EPG,NVOD and runs on PCs 
or Embeded devices Linux OS.I hopes more developers can join this project
 and work together with developers to make ExpressTVPlayer better and 
 better!
 
Finally we realize the following effects:
1.ExpressTVPlayer can show EPG and NVOD,
2.support DVB,T-DMB and CMMB(china),
3.supprot VRML and realize interactice effect.
4.ExpressTVPlayer can get data from file that exits harddisk. 
  ExpressTVPlayer can get ts stream from tuner and rtp/rtsp packets over network.
5.ExpressTVPlayer run on PC's linux OS or embeded linux OS.
6.Interface(skin) have good compatibility whith many GUIs.
7.Codecs can take full advantage of hard device speedup.
8.ExpressTVPlayer can support a lot CPUs such as ARM,X86,SH-4,MIPS and so on.

Haha, that's great!
